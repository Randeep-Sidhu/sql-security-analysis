# Security Analysis with SQL Filters

## Overview
This project focuses on enhancing system security for an organization by investigating potential security issues and updating employee computers. I used SQL filters to analyze login attempts and employee data for security-related tasks.

## Summary
I applied filters to SQL queries to retrieve specific information on login attempts and employee machines using the `log_in_attempts` and `employees` tables. I utilized AND, OR, NOT operators, and LIKE with the % wildcard to filter patterns effectively.
